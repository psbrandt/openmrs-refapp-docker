# OpenMRS Reference Application Docker (Debian Linux)

> Docker containers for [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org) Reference Application

This repository contains the necessary infrastructure code and related resources
required to compose and run Docker containers that start an instance
of the OpenMRS Reference Application on [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/).

> :bulb: See the [`alpine` branch](https://github.com/psbrandt/openmrs-refapp-docker/tree/alpine) for images
that run on Alpine Linux.

For more information about the OpenMRS Reference Application visit [openmrs.org](http://www.openmrs.org/).

## Running

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### Composition

To run containers use the prebuilt images, first get the compose file:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psbrandt/openmrs-refapp-docker/master/docker-compose-prebuilt.yml
```

Then pull the images:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prebuilt.yml pull
```

Once the pull is complete, you'll have to make sure that the mysql container
is initialized due to [this limitation](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/81).
Do this by running the following:

````
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prebuilt.yml up openmrs-refapp-mysql
````

When it's done you can press <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> to stop the container. You will only have
to do this the first time.

After this you can run the OpenMRS Reference Application by executing the following:

````
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prebuilt.yml up
````

## Access

To log into OpenMRS Reference Application, use the following details:

* **Host**: `DOCKER_HOST:8080/openmrs`
* **User**: admin
* **Pass**: Admin123

## Building

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

### Setup

Start by cloning this repository:

````
git clone https://github.com/psbrandt/openmrs-refapp-docker.git
````

Enter the directory and build the images:

````
cd openmrs-refapp-docker
docker-compose build
````

Once the build is complete, you'll have to make sure that the mysql container
is initialized due to [this limitation](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/81).
Do this by running the following:

````
docker-compose up openmrs-refapp-mysql
````

When it's done you can press <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> to stop the container. You will only have
to do this the first time.

After this you can run the OpenMRS Reference Application by executing the following:

````
docker-compose up
````

## Troubleshooting

> Could not create connection to database server. Attempted reconnect 3 times. Giving up.

Since it's not currently possible to order the startup of Docker containers,
sometimes the Tomcat container will start before the MySQL container. As a result,
OpenMRS might not get a database connection on start up. To work around this,
stop the containers and restart them:

````
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start
````

Or if you are using the prebuilt images:

````
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prebuilt.yml stop
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prebuilt.yml start
````
